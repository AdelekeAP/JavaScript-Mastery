    //FUNCTIONS ARE VALUES like numbers,string , boolean
    //this function below allows us use hoisting i.e calling function in lines before it is actually declared, and hoisting wont work when you save function in a variable
    greeting();
    function greeting(){
      console.log('hello');
    }
   greeting();

   const num = 2;
   const function1 = function(){ //as long as there is a way to access function then function name is not needed, anonymous functions are functions with no name 
    console.log('hello2')
   }

   console.log(function1);
   console.log(typeof function1);

   function1();

   //FUNCTION VALUE AND OBJECTS
   const object1 = {
    num: 2,
    fun: function(){
      console.log('hello3');
    }
   };

   object1.fun() //function in an object is a method, ass long ss there is a way to acces it we do not need function name

   //FUNCTIONS VALUES AND FUNCTIONS
   function display(param){//PASSING A VALUE IN A FUNCTION
    console.log(param);
   }
   display(2);

   function run(param){//PASSING IN A FUNCTION IN A FUNCTION
    param(); //because parm contains function we can just call it
   }
   run(function(){ //function we pass in is called a CALLBACK FUNCTION or CALLBACK
    console.log('hello4')
   })

   //ANYTHING YOU CAN DO WITH A VALUE YOU CAN DO WITH A FUNCTION

    /*set timeout built in function and it allows us run a function in the future
   setTimeout(function(){ //asynchronouse does not block our code it sets up timer in background 
    console.log('timeout');
    console.log('timeout2'); //all code in this function is synchronous code
   }, 3000); //takes 2 parameters, 1st one is a function we want to run in the future , and we are using it as a value . 2nd parameter is how long you want to wait before function is run and it is in milliseconds

   console.log('next line'); //next line run firsts as this is asynchronous code i.e next line wontwait for a line to finish before going to the next line
   syncrhonouse code will wait for on eline to finish before going to the next line


   //SETINTERVAL , another built in func and takes in same paramaters as setTimeout and it is also asynchronous 
   setInterval(function(){
    console.log('interval') //runs function every 3 seconds
   },3000)
   //setinterval returns a number and the number is like an id that we use to stop the interval

    */
    //ANOTHER WAY TO LOOP THROUGH AN ARRAY USING FOREACH AN ARRAY METHOD
    //for each loops through array and for each value in array it will save value in parameter and run the function and forEach is the preferred way to loop through array
    [
      'make dinner',
      'wash dishes',
      'watch youtube'
    ].forEach(function(value, index){ //takes make dinner save it paramater and run the fuction which will make an iteration
        if(value === "wash dishes "){
          return; //this is similar to continue in loops but if we want to use break it is better to use a regular for loop 
        }
        console.log(index);
        console.log(value);
    });
