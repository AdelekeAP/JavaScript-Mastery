    JSON is a js object with less features i.e it does not support functions, and  properties and values should be in double quotes,
     JSON syntax is more universal i.e we send json to send data between computers that might use different programming langaugges as json syntax unlike javascript object only understoood in js
    can be understood by every programming languages  
    built in jSON object allows us convert JS object to json JSON.stringify
    JSON TO JS OBJECT 
    JSON.parse()
    json.stringify returns a string while json.parse returns an object  

    console.log(JSON.stringify(product2)); //stringify is a method of JSON object i.e is a function insdie the JSON object, stringify also results in a string
    
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2) 
    console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString));

    
    null means you intentionally want something to be empty e.g 
    function func(par1 = 'default'){
      console.log(par1);
    }

    func(); returns default and func(undefined) returns string default

    func(null); returns null
    func(undefined); returns default
    
    
    local storage does not get deleted when you refresh a page 
    


    console.log('hello'.length); // string method tells us how long string is
    console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); //string method gices us copy of string in uppercase*/

    /* strings can have properties and methods without being objects because javascript wraps these strings in a special object first and this object has mproperty length and method to uppercase , this feature is called autoboxing because JS string in object like a box , it works with values like numbers and booleans but does not work with null and undefined*/


    /* message:'hello' is not stored a value stored in object1 , when we create this object the value is saved somewhere in the computers memeory, and this object1 variable just has a reference that points to location in the computers memory , and this makes language more efficient */
    const object1 = { //object1 has the reference to the value , and reference is what points to somewhere in memory 
      message: 'hello'

    };

    const object2 = object1; //we are not actually copying the object into variable ,we are copying the refernce so they both point to same object in memory, so if obj1 is changed obj2 will also be changed
    console.log(object1);
    console.log(object2);


    object1.message = 'good job!';
    console.log(object1);  //object1 can be change messge property even though we  created with const because variable(object1) contains reference that points to the object , const prevents us from changing the reference in variable but does not prevent us from reaching into the reference and changing the object that it is pointing to, so we can still change value in obj even if we use const 

    const object3 = {
      message: 'good job!'

    };

    console.log(object1===object3); //returns false as you cannot compare values in objects you compare the references amd these objects have the different references in the object memory , to compare you do that manually by checking the message property in each objects
    console.log(object2 === object1) //returns true because they have same object reference



    const object4 = {
      message: 'good job!',
      price: 799
    };
    DESTRUCTURING
    const message = object4.message;// code below does samme as this
    const { message, price  } = object4; //takes message property out of object4 and save it in a variable called message;
    console.log(message);
    console.log(price);
    //if variable name and property name are the same there is a shortcut known as destructing as seen above, it is an easier way to take properties out of an object

    //this code is to assign value in message variable to message propety in the object5 so console logging object returns message propertyy and whatever valUe is in the object5
   
    const object5 = {
      // message: message  //shorcut for this if variable name and property have the same name is to just write message
      message, //shorthand property
      
      
      SHORTHAND METHOD
      // method: function function1(){
      //   console.log('method');
      // }

      //this code below does the same as the one above to create the function, it is a shorthand method
      method (){
        console.log('method');
      }
    };
    
    console.log(object5);

    object5.method();
